```

2.  Add your config into config.py, following the instructions in config.example.py

id = 12345  # Your API ID
hash = "11223344556677889900AABBCCDDEEFF"  # API Hash
admins = 12346789  # Any "admins" for the bot that will be able to reload the plugins
```

## FAQ
1.  A user deleted their account, why hasn't the bot kicked them yet?

*  ADAB only checks for deleted accounts ONCE every 6 hours at most.  And it will only check for deleted accounts if a message was sent to the group.  This behaviour will keep the bot from slowing down too much by filtering out inactive groups.

2.  Does ADAB kick or ban deleted accounts?

*  ADAB kicks deleted accounts (ban + unban).

3.  Does ADAB work in channels?

*  Yes.  It doesn't matter what permission you give it in broadcast channels, all channel admins have the permission to kick/ban.

4.  How do I run it persistently, or in the background?

*  Use something like tmux: `tmux new -ds AntiDeletedAccountsBot "python3 stdbot.py"`
